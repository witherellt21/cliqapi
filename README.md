# CLIQ - An application designed for organizing your TV media experience

## Overview
Cliq is designed to be a fully encompassing application that replaces the discovery, organization, and review forum for TV shows/movies. Search for the TV shows that your friends liked the most, or keep up to date with anything they recently watched on their feed; get alerts for new episodes of active shows, or view your calendar to see a big picture. Finally, rate your favorite movies and TV shows by comparing them to shows you have already watched in our automatic rating system, then post a description of your review to your timeline!
